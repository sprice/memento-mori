# Memento Mori

![Memento Mori](./memento_mori.png)

_Memento Mori_ is latin for “Remember (that you have to) die”.

This is a Mac OS app that displays in your menu bar the estimated number of days you have left to live.

## Why?

I’ve used Aaron Franks’ [Hammerspoon Mortality Plugin](https://github.com/af/dotfiles/blob/main/hammerspoon/mortality.lua) for years. It’s great.

Having begun coding with Cursor, I wondered if I could build a Mac OS app with zero Swift knowledge. It turns out you can!

Look! There’s a [directory in here](https://github.com/sprice/memento-mori/tree/main/Memento%20Mori.xcodeproj/xcuserdata/shawnprice.xcuserdatad/xcschemes) with my computer username in it! I have no idea how any of this works!

## No, The Other Why?

Life is short.
