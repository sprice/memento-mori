# Memento Mori Development Workflow

## Development Environment

1. Primary IDE: Cursor
2. Secondary IDE: Xcode (required for certain tasks)

## Development Process

1. Write Swift code in Cursor IDE
2. Use Xcode for interface builder and asset management
3. Switch between Cursor and Xcode as needed

## Building and Running

1. Open the project in Xcode
2. Select the target device (e.g., My Mac)
3. Click the "Run" button (play icon) or use `Cmd + R`

## Running Tests

1. In Xcode, use `Cmd + U` to run all tests
2. To run specific tests, navigate to the test file and click the diamond icon next to the test method

## Debugging

1. Set breakpoints in Cursor or Xcode
2. Run the app in debug mode from Xcode
3. Use Xcode's debug console and interface for debugging

## Version Control

1. Use Git for version control
2. Commit changes from Cursor IDE or use a separate Git client

## App Store Submission

1. In Xcode, select "Product" > "Archive"
2. Once archived, click "Distribute App"
3. Follow the App Store submission process in Xcode

## Workflow Tips

1. Keep Xcode open for quick access to interface builder and running/testing
2. Use Cursor for most code editing tasks
3. Regularly build and run the app to catch errors early
4. Commit changes frequently

## Important Files

- Main App File:
  - swift:Memento Mori/Memento_MoriApp.swift

- Content View:
  - swift: Memento Mori/ContentView.swift

- Data Model:
  - swift: Memento Mori/Item.swift


Remember to regularly switch between Cursor and Xcode as needed, especially when working with interface elements or preparing for app submission.
